// [] Missing Value
// You are given an array of length N that contains, in no particular order, integers from 0 to N. One integer value is missing. Quickly determine and return the missing value. Given ([3,0,1]), return 2. Second: now the lowest value can now be any integer (including negatives), instead of always being 0. Given ([2,-4,0,-3,-2,1]) return -1. Given ([5,2,7,8,4,9,3]), return 6.
