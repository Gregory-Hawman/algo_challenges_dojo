// [] Array: Mode
// Back in the Basic 13, you wrote code to compute an array’s minimum and maximum values. You also wrote code to determine average value (the “mean”). What about the “mode” – the most common value in that data set. Create a function that, given an array, returns the most frequent value in the array.

// Second: memory constraints prevent your using a new array. How does this affect your solution?
