// [] Max of Subarray Sums
// How efficient can you be on this following final challenge? The input may hold many million values.

// Given a numerical array that is potentially very long, return the maximum sum of values from a subarray. Any consecutive sequence of indices in the array is considered a subarray. Create a function that returns the highest sum possible from these subarrays. Given [1,2,-4,3,-2,3,-1], you should return 4 (for subarray [3,-2,3]), and given [-1,-2,-4,-3,-2,-3], return 0 (for []). This problem has many possible implementations. Which do you prefer & why?
