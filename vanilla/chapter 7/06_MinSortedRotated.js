// [] Min of Sorted-Rotated
// You will be given a numerical array that has first been sorted, then rotated by an unknown amount. Find and return the minimum value in that array. Donâ€™t use built-in functions (surprise!). Given the input array ["Gigli","Jay is cool","Mavis","Phoebe","Thurber","Anna","Celeste","Elon"], you should return "Anna". Remember, do not linearly iterate the array!
