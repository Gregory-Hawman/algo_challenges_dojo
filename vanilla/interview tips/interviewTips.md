Interview Tips
Students sometimes wonder what
language to use in technical interviews. The answer of course:
“whatever language they tell you.” What if you don’t know what they
prefer? Or, what if you are not strong in that language? Don’t
despair! Most interviewers will say “Use whatever language makes
you most productive….” (while they are also thinking “...as long as it
is appropriate for this problem….”). So, don’t choose Ruby to solve a
graphics firmware problem; don’t use Fortran in a web interview.
Except for specialized roles, it is safe to write in JavaScript, Java, C#
or C++. As you know, this course focuses on JavaScript: it is
universal to all web front-ends and has growing server-side usage
with Node.js.
Interviewing is an artificial situation. Like anything else, you improve
your performance with practice. Even post- bootcamp, code on
whiteboard and paper, to simulate interviews. Resist the urge to
code only at a computer. Once you complete a solution, then debug
it at a computer. What common errors do you make on whiteboard or
paper? Note these and refer back to them over time.
How and what you communicate to interviewers is as important as
getting the right solution. Remember that they can’t read your mind;
always think out loud. As you mentally run through multiple
possibilities, discarding numerous dead-end ideas, it behooves you
to provide visibility into your thought process.
Don’t jump in and start writing code immediately. Ask clarifying
questions – the answers might surprise you. Often, interviewers are
intentionally vague, to test whether you can extract unstated
requirements. Ensuring you understand the intention upfront is
important. Ask about extreme inputs, including those that violate
expectations (whether intentional or not) – jot these on a corner of
the whiteboard to double-check later. Restate to the interviewer your
understanding of the problem. Write out a few important inputs, with
expected outputs. If you think of multiple ways to solve the problem
(perhaps even if not), it is enlightening to ask “What should we
optimize for?” Really listen to the interviewer’s response here.
Sooner or later you must start coding – don’t let pre-coding stretch
out. A common-sense tip: start coding in the whiteboard’s upper left
corner; leave room so you avoid lots of arrows (good engineers plan
ahead, just sayin’…). Start with the function’s signature (name and
inputs) and a few lines of input checking, just to get ink on the board.
If you get stuck, try not to stall – leave a comment or pseudocode
and mention that you will come back to this. Keep going; maintain
velocity. Mid-stream, you may realize there is a much better solution.
Don’t keep it a secret; your interviewer already knows this. Mention
the new idea, but suggest that you keep going in order to finish a
solution in the time you have. Once you complete something, run
through your test cases before declaring a function done.
Remember your RIOT WALK! (Recap, inputs/outputs, tests,
walkthrough the code.) Do it. Every time.
Again: always keep your ears open for interviewer hints and
guidance. They want you to succeed!
Good luck! -mp
