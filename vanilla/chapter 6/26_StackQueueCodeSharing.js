// [] Stack / Queue Code-Sharing
// As a design exercise, think through how you would combine the SLQueue you wrote previously with the SLStack class you just created. Would you use object-oriented design? If so, which class inherits from which? Is there a parent class that is neither?

// Once youâ€™ve done the thought work, now it is time to code it: rework what you wrote for SLQueue and SLStack (or start from scratch, calling these SLQueue2 and SLStack2) with code sharing in mind. When you are done, someone should be able to create new queue and stack objects and use all the methods for those classes. Your combined codebase should be only about 15% larger than SLQueue!
