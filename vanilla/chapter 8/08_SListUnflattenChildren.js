// [] SList: Unflatten Children
// Take the output from your “flatten child lists” function (a linear linked list containing nodes with .child pointers), and restore it to its original state. Do you need to change your flatten function to enable this? 

// Second: for flatten & unflatten, in the case of really complex inputs, how many nested FOR (or WHILE) loops might you have? Can you solve without nested loops, even for complex inputs?
