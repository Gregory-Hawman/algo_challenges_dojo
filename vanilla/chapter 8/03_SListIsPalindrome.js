// [] SList: Is Palindrome
// Return whether a list is a palindrome. String palindromes read the same front-to-back and back-to-front. Here, compare node values. N.B.: to be accurate in JavaScript, use === instead of ==, since 1 == true == [1] == "1".

// Second: you may not have plentiful memory. Can you solve this without an additional array?
