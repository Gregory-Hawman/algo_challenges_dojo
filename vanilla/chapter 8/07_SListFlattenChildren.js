// [] SList: Flatten Children
// Why limit nodes to contain only one pointer? In this challenge, each node has .next, but also .child that is either null or points to another head. In turn each child node could point to another list. Don’t alter .child; arrange .next pointers to ‘flatten’ the hierarchy into one linear list, from head through all others via .next.
