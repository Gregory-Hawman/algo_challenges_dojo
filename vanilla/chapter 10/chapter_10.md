Chapter 10 – Strings, Part II

This chapter we revisit strings, having mastered the fine art of recursion. Remember: recursion is not an answer to every problem; everything that can be solved with recursion can also be solved without.

Recall that strings are immutable. Individual elements (characters) within the set cannot be altered, but an entire string can be replaced by a new one. For this reason, one can (even though it feels like cheating) execute a statement like myString = myString + ", dude!". The entire myString object is replaced by a new one that just so happens to be based on the old one.

When string questions are asked in interviews, it is always worth asking whether you are allowed to use built-in string library functions. It might be the case that the interviewer just wants to know whether you are aware of the built-ins, and will readily allow you to avail yourself of them. In many other cases, though, the intention is for you to work in low-level primitives, often duplicating one or more built-in string library functions. These questions can be tedious, but they are still exceedingly common.

In challenges this chapter, do not use built-in string methods unless they are explicitly mentioned. This means you must work with strings simply as immutable arrays of characters. One exception: when capitalization is mentioned, you are allowed to use.toLowerCase() and .toUpperCase().

Let’s revisit strings with recursion in mind. Recursion is often quite valuable, as shown in this chapter.
