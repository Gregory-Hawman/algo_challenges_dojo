// [] Towers of Hanoi
// Create an algorithm to solve the Towers of Hanoi game. In the Towers of Hanoi, there are three poles and a stack of disks that fit onto the poles. The disks range from largest (on bottom) to smallest (on top), currently all on pole A. Moving only one disk at a time, move the stack to pole C. You can use any of the three poles you wish. A larger disk can never be placed on top of a smaller disk. How many moves does it take to relocate six disks from pole A to pole C? What is the first move?
