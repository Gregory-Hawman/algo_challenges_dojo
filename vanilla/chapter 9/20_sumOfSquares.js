// [] Sum of Squares
// Mike enjoys teaching the “lego concept” to beginning HTML/CSS students: breaking a web page into different rectangles. There is something about squares that appeals to his sense of balance. Given an integer, calculate and print all combinations of square integers that sum to that integer. No duplicates are allowed among smaller integers. sumOfSquares(10) => “1 + 9”. sumOfSquares(30) => “1 + 4 + 25, 1 + 4 + 9 + 16”. Solve recursively with no loops.
