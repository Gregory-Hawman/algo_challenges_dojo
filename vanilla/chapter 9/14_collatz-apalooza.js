// Define a function that, given positive integer num, returns num/2 if num is even or 3*num + 1 if num is odd. Continuously feeding result back into function results in numerical series such as 5,16,8,4,2,1. According to Dr. Lothar Collatz, the series always reaches 1 (and then repeats 4,2,1,4,2,1,â€¦). What starting number requires the most iterations before reaching 1 the first time?
