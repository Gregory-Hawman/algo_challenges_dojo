// [] Recursive “Tribonacci”
// Write function rTrib(num) to mimic Fibonacci, adding previous three values instead of two. First three Tribonacci numbers are 0, 0, 1, so rTrib(3) = 1 (0+0+1); rTrib(4) = 2 (0+1+1); rTrib(5) = 4 (1+1+2); rTrib(6) = 7 (1+2+4). Handle negatives and non-integers appropriately and inexpensively.
