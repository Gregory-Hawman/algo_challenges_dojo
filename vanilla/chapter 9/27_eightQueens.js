// [] Eight Queens
// Build eightQueens() using previous solutions. Return all arrangements of eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard, so no queen threatens any other. How would you best return these results?

// Second: write a helper function that displays the queens-located-onthe- board results returned, in awesomely-retro character graphics, using console.log().
