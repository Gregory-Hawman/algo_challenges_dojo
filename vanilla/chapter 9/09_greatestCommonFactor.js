// [] Greatest Common Factor
// Given two integers, create rGCF(num1,num2) to recursively determine Greatest Common Factor (the largest integer dividing evenly into both). Greek mathematician Euclid demonstrated these facts:

    // 1) gcf(a,b) == a, if a == b;
    // 2) gcf(a,b) == gcf(a-b,b), if a>b;
    // 3) gcf(a,b) == gcf(a,b-a), if b>a.

// Second: rework facts #2 and #3 to reduce stack consumption and expand rGCF’s reach. You should be able to compute rGCF(123456,987654).
