// [] N Queens
// Create nQueens(n,xSize,ySize) using previous work, returning all arrangements of N unthreatened queens on X by Y rectangular board. eightQueens() == nQueens(8,8,8). 

// Second: optimize your solution so that you can extend n, xSize and ySize as far as possible before you exhaust the available memory. Can you get as high as 15 queens on a 15x15 board?
