// [] Uneven Digits
// Cami doesn’t know why, but she’s just in an odd mood today. Let’s make all numerals odd for her. Given an integer, recursively return the integer formed by stripping out all even digits in original. Solve without loops. uneven(-1845) = -15; uneven(79) = 79; uneven(20) = 0; uneven(-92) = -9.
