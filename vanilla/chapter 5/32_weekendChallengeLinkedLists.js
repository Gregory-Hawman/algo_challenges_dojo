// [] Weekend Challenge: Linked Lists
// This weekend, create an SList with nodes containing.id, .firstName and .lastName in addition to the obligatory .next. After creating SList and SLNode constructors, write code to do the following:

// Create a list and at least five unique nodes, and add the nodes to the list.

// Build a function that reorders list nodes to be alphabetized by .lastName.

// Refactor this code to accept a boolean, representing whether to sort ascending or descending.

// Now, augment the code to sort by any of these attributes, as well as ascending or descending.

// Refactor the function to sort by more than one attribute. For example, we may want to “Sort the list by last name (ascending), using ID (descending) as a tiebreaker if last names are equal.”

// Is any of this challenge easier if our nodes contain a .prev in addition to a .next?
