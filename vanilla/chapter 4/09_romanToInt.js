// [] Roman Numerals to Integer
// Sept 16, 2014 headline: “Ancient Computer Found in Roman Shipwreck”. Comprising 30 bronze gears, its wooden frame features 2000 characters. Given a string containing a Roman numeral representation of a positive integer, return the integer. Remember that III is 3, DCIX is 609 and MXDII is 1492. 

// Challenge answered: console.log(1 + 2 + "3" + "4" + 5 + 6) will output "33456". Num+num is a num, but num+str or str+num is a str: 1+2==3. 3+"3"=="33". "334"+5=="3345".
